## Wishlist

- Microformats on blog pages
- Need to edit all issues (hopefully via an automated process) to add formatting
  to the comments. It looks like we can use the regex
  `/^Posted by [^(]+)\([^)+\) on \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}/s`, and put a
  `---` above it or make that line a level 4 heading.
- Need to review all issues to fix code blocks. We *may* be able to automate
  this, but I'm not 100% convinced it's possible.
