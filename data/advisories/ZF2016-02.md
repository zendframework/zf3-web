# ZF2016-02: Potential SQL injection in ORDER and GROUP statements of Zend\_Db\_Select

The implementation of `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` in `Zend_Db_Select` of ZF1 is
vulnerable by the following SQL injection:

```php
$db = Zend_Db::factory(/* options here */);
$select = new Zend_Db_Select($db);
$select->from('p');
$select->order("MD5(\"(\");DELETE FROM p2; #)"); // same with group()
```

The above `$select` will render the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT `p`.* FROM `p` ORDER BY MD5("");DELETE FROM p2; #) ASC
```

instead of the correct one:

```sql
SELECT `p`.* FROM `p` ORDER BY "MD5("""");DELETE FROM p2; #)" ASC
```

This security fix can be considered as an improvement of the previous 
[ZF2014-04](/security/advisory/ZF2014-04).

## Action Taken

We fixed the reported SQL injection using two regular expressions for the `order()` and the `group()`
methods in `Zend_Db_Select`, created as the class constants `REGEX_COLUMN_EXPR_ORDER` and
`REGEX_COLUMN_EXPR_GROUP`, respectively. These are defined as:

```
/^([\w]+\s*\(([^\(\)]|(?1))*\))$/
```

This regexp is different from the previous `REGEX_COLUMN_EXPR`, which used the
character patterm `[\w]*`; we now require at least one word boundary (`[\w]+`).

**The patch is available starting in Zend Framework 1.12.19.**

## Other Information

This SQL injection attack does not affect Zend Framework 2 and 3 versions because the
implementations of `Zend\Db\Sql\Select::order()` and `Zend\Db\Sql\Select::group()` do
not manage parenthetical expressions.

### Acknowledgments

The Zend Framework team thanks the following for identifying the issues and
working with us to help protect its users:

- Peter O'Callaghan, who discovered and reported the issue;
- [Enrico Zimuel](http://www.zimuel.it), who provided the patch.
