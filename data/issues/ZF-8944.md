ZF-8944: fetchRow() ignores limit offset
----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-01-26T12:28:29.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-04-27T20:21:52.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.2 (24/Feb/10)
 
 Reporter:  Lauri Elevant (clon)  Assignee:  Mickael Perraud (mikaelkael)  Tags: - Zend\_Db
 
 Related issues: - [ZF-10598](/issues/browse/ZF-10598)

### Description

In the fetchRow() method in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract I find this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      if (!($where instanceof Zend_Db_Table_Select)) {
        /* snip */
      } else {
        $select = $where->limit(1);
      }


So whenever you pass a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select object including a limit with an offset, say LIMIT 1 OFFSET 10, it overrules it with just LIMIT 1, even though in both cases the resulting rowset contains a maximum of 1 rows. This is unexpected and silently breaks the meaning of the select, resulting in a wrong row being returned.

Steps to reproduce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    $select = $teams->select()
      ->where('colour = ?', 'orange')
      ->order('result')
      ->limit(1,10);
              
    echo (string) $teams;
    // SELECT `teams`.* FROM `teams` WHERE (colour = 'orange') ORDER BY `result` ASC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 10
            
    $teams->fetchRow($teams);
    // SELECT `teams`.* FROM `teams` WHERE (colour = 'orange') ORDER BY `result` ASC LIMIT 1
    


Suggested fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $where->limit(1, $where->getPart(Zend_Db_Select::LIMIT_OFFSET));

Created a unit test based on the comments. Wasn't able to reproduce the error.

Unit test added with r21101 and correction for Pdo\_Oci

Tests OK against all databases without changes to code (trunk and 1.10 branch):

Please reopen if the problem always occurs.

While you patched the unit test, I don't see that you fixed the root issue?

I opened the ticket that duplicates this one at version 1.10.8 (this one was reported fixed at 1.10.2, but I don't see the patch in the code here on 1.11.3). Would you please double check this issue?

This was a patch against 1.10.8, but you should be able to fix in the current version.

Sorry but there has to be something that I don't understand now... why I cannot see the test method here [[http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/因(http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/tests/Zend/Db/Select/TestCommon.php)]?

 

 

Posted by Mickael Perraud (mikaelkael) on 2011-04-27T20:21:52.000+0000

Because it's in [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/因(http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/tests/Zend/Db/Table/Select/TestCommon.php) (with Table/Select instead of Select) ;)
