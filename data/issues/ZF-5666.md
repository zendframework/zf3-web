### Description

There's a bug in the jQuery UI TabContainer helper that makes the tabs not render correctly.

Screenshot of tabs: ![http://freeimagehosting.net/uploads/因(http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/th.5a232fe8db.png)! <a href="">www.freeimagehosting.net/image.php?5a232fe8db.png</a>" rel="nofollow">Full Size

The problem is the addition of child element in the javascript function, as shown in the below diff that fixed the problem.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Diff output
    122c122
    <         $js = sprintf('%s("#%s > ul").tabs(%s);',
    ---
    >         $js = sprintf('%s("#%s").tabs(%s);',

Hello Brian,

can you tell me the jQuery UI Version that you are using?

Schedulded for the next release (Either 1.8 or 1.7.5)

Hi, I am trying to get this component working for subforms and mine does not display with tabs.

It does work with the following diff (and without the diff noted previously):

93c93 < $list = '

<

ul class="ui-tabs-nav">'.PHP\_EOL;
----------------------------------

> $list = '

- '.PHP\_EOL; 133c133 < . '



'.PHP\_EOL;
-----------

> . '</div></div>'.PHP_EOL;

I am using the following JQuery includes:

The screenshots look like they were taken from the example at [http://zendframework.com/manual/en/因(http://www.zendframework.com/manual/en/zendx.jquery.form.html)

I was trying to get that example working before implementing with my own forms and am wondering if the rest of the example is available somewhere (headers, javascript, css stylesheet).

@Laura: which UI version and which stylesheet are you using?

Here are the contents of my jquerytest.phtml (jquerytestAction in the controller is taken directly from [http://zendframework.com/manual/en/因(http://www.zendframework.com/manual/en/zendx.jquery.form.html)):

- - - - - -

jQuery UI Tabs - Default functionality<?=$this->form ?>
-----------------

I did also try adding this line with same functional results (different styling):

ZendX is from the Zend 1.7.4 release.

(Sorry for the slow replay, was expecting the issue tracker to email me... will have to look for that setting...)

Okay, I get it... should have been $("#tabContainer").tabs() in the javascript...

I still think it would be useful to add this to the example, along with the javascript and stylesheet includes.
