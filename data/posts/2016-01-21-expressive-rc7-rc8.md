This release candidate contains bug fixes for dispatching error middleware pipelines. Additionally, we've released a new version of our Twig integration, and detail those changes below.

Changes in zend-expressive RC7
------------------------------

RC6 updated the configuration for the middleware pipeline to make it a single pipeline. We recommended that developers make use of our middleware grouping feature, however, which allows you to specify not just a single, named middleware service, but an _array_ of named middleware services. This feature is great for grouping middleware based on when it should execute, and makes ordering related middleware simpler.

Per our suggested, default configuration:


    <code class="language-php">use Zend\Expressive\Container\ApplicationFactory;
    use Zend\Expressive\Helper;

    return [
        'dependencies' => [
            'factories' => [
                Helper\ServerUrlMiddleware::class => Helper\ServerUrlMiddlewareFactory::class,
                Helper\UrlHelperMiddleware::class => Helper\UrlHelperMiddlewareFactory::class,
            ],
        ],
        // This can be used to seed pre- and/or post-routing middleware
        'middleware_pipeline' => [
            // An array of middleware to register. Each item is of the following
            // specification:
            //
            // [
            //  Required:
            //     'middleware' => 'Name or array of names of middleware services and/or callables',
            //  Optional:
            //     'path'     => '/path/to/match', // string; literal path prefix to match
            //                                     // middleware will not execute
            //                                     // if path does not match!
            //     'error'    => true, // boolean; true for error middleware
            //     'priority' => 1, // int; higher values == register early;
            //                      // lower/negative == register last;
            //                      // default is 1, if none is provided.
            // ],
            //
            // While the ApplicationFactory ignores the keys associated with
            // specifications, they can be used to allow merging related values
            // defined in multiple configuration files/locations. This file defines
            // some conventional keys for middleware to execute early, routing
            // middleware, and error middleware.
            'always' => [
                'middleware' => [
                    // Add more middleware here that you want to execute on
                    // every request:
                    // - bootstrapping
                    // - pre-conditions
                    // - modifications to outgoing responses
                    Helper\ServerUrlMiddleware::class,
                ],
                'priority' => 10000,
            ],

            'routing' => [
                'middleware' => [
                    ApplicationFactory::ROUTING_MIDDLEWARE,
                    Helper\UrlHelperMiddleware::class,
                    // Add more middleware here that needs to introspect the routing
                    // results; this might include:
                    // - route-based authentication
                    // - route-based validation
                    // - etc.
                    ApplicationFactory::DISPATCH_MIDDLEWARE,
                ],
                'priority' => 1,
            ],

            'error' => [
                'middleware' => [
                    // Add error middleware here.
                ],
                'priority' => -10000,
                'error' => true,
            ],
        ],
    ];


Unfortunately, for _error middleware_, this was not working correctly.

Internally, when we encounter an array of middleware, we create a `Zend\Stratigility\MiddlewarePipe` instance, and pipe each middleware service to it in order. The problem is that `MiddlewarePipe` does not implement the error middleware signature — which meant that error middleware pipelines were completely skipped!

To make this work, we introduced a proxy class, `Zend\Expressive\ErrorMiddlewarePipe`, which wraps a `MiddlewarePipe`, and exposes the error middleware signature. This is now used internally whenever an error middleware pipeline needs to be created.

Changes in zend-expressive-skeleton RC8
---------------------------------------

When we created the new default middleware pipeline configuration for RC6/RC7, we forgot one important detail: the `error` middleware group was missing its `error` key, meaning it wasn't attempting to create error middleware at all! We've fixed this in RC8.

If you upgraded to RC6/RC7 earlier this week, make sure you add that `error` key, as detailed in the above example.

Twig integration updates
------------------------

Today we released [version 1.0.1 of our Twig integration](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer/releases/tag/1.1.0). This includes a few new features:

- It adds a dependency on zend-expressive-helpers and, if the `UrlHelper` and `ServerUrlHelper` services are registered, makes new `url` and `absolute_url` template functions available.
- It adds a new "globals" configuration sub-section for registering variables to pass to all templates.

You can read more in the [Twig integration documentation](http://zend-expressive.readthedocs.org/en/latest/template/twig/).

Many thanks to [Geert Eltink](https://xtreamwayz.com) for these new features!

Future
------

Code is stabilizing, and we're seeing fewer issues hitting our issue tracker. We hope that in a week or two we can release a stable version.

If you are testing Expressive — whether for the first time, or updating an existing application — please help us prepare it for general availability!
